      <h3>Ayoub Hussin</h3>
      <p> I have learned alot during Bootcamp. It was my first time coding and it was fun as I learned alot of new stuff.For example, the map methode which was quite useful as you can see i used it in my project.Futher now in the future, i learned about Java where using the CIty engine to make the game. I really enjoyed this moodle as i can now create gui and character flying enemies collision and etc.. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Perfect Loop using arc</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of  loops, and class. I created repeating loop using Constrain methode
	and also the map methode in an arc. As you can see i used toe map in the stroke 
	to make the stroke goes darker and fader as it moves upwards or downwards.

      <h3>Java project 2d Game :Fighting 2d Game</h3>
      <p> my game is based on a childhood Anime and its basically deafeating villians and killing the Last Boss. you can fight the enemy by shooting them with projectiles by using the KEY E or by mouse where you can shoot any direction. as you progress through levels , get new items and tricks unlocked.Example flying and shooting bombs.It was a great opportunity to learn about object interactions files and Mostly GUI. The most challenging was implementing a store GUI which u can buy health using the money u collect </p>
